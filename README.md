### Project Description

BloomMama is a personalized pregnancy care website that provides month-wise guidance on diet, exercise, posture, safety, and emotional well-being for expectant mothers. By entering their due date, users receive tailored tips, reminders, and support throughout their pregnancy journey. The platform brings reliable information and care into one place to promote a safe and healthy pregnancy experience.
### The Problem statement
Many pregnant women lack access to clear, reliable, and month-wise guidance on diet, exercise, posture, safety, and emotional well-being. Information is often scattered across different sources, leading to confusion and stress. There is a need for a single, personalized platform that provides structured pregnancy care support throughout each stage of pregnancy.

### The Solution
Our project provides personalized, month-wise care including diet, exercise, posture, and emotional support.
We also include AI chat assistance and reminders to ensure safe and healthy pregnant journey.
